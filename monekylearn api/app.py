When it comes to evaluating the performance of keyword extractors, you can use some of the standard metrics in machine learning: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, these metrics donâ€™t reflect partial matches; they only consider the perfect match between an extracted segment and the correct prediction for that tag.
