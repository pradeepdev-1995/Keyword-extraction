# Textrank

Textrank is an python package for summarizing text and extracting keywords. The algorithm calculates how words are related to one another by looking if words are following one another. Then, it uses the PageRank algorithm to rank the most important words from the text. I am appending the textrank implementation along with the spacy pipeline.
